### Computational Inefficiencies and Anti-patterns

#### 1. **Type Definition Error**
   **Problem:**  
   The `WalletBalance` and `FormattedWalletBalance` interfaces are missing the `blockchain` property, which is referenced in the code. This can lead to TypeScript errors.

   **Solution:**  
   Add `blockchain` to both interfaces to align the types with the code. Additionally, ensure all properties are accounted for when defining types.

#### 2. **Wrong Variable Reference**
   **Problem:**  
   In the filter function, `lhsPriority` is used but it is not defined. It should be using `balancePriority`, which is calculated earlier.

   **Solution:**  
   Fix the reference to `balancePriority` instead of `lhsPriority` in the filter function.

#### 3. **Do not need to use  `useMemo`**
   **Problem:**  
   The `prices` variable is included in the dependency array of `useMemo`, but it is not used in the `useMemo` body. This will cause unnecessary re-renders.

   **Solution:**  
   Remove `prices` from the dependency array in `useMemo` if it is not being used in that specific calculation.

#### 4. **Inconsistent Return in Sort Comparator**
   **Problem:**  
   The sort comparator does not return a value when the priorities are equal. It can cause issues, as a sort function should always return either `-1`, `1`, or `0` for equal elements.

   **Solution:**  
   Ensure that the comparator returns `0` when the priorities are equal.

#### 5. **Problem with data Flow**
   **Problem:**  
   `formattedBalances` is created but never used. Instead, `sortedBalances` is mapped again to format the balance values when it could be done in a single operation.

   **Solution:**  
   Combine the filtering, sorting, and formatting logic into a single `useMemo` block to avoid redundant operations.

#### 6. **Using Index as Key**
   **Problem:**  
   Using the index of the `map()` can lead to performance issues

   **Solution:**  
   Change to unique valuee, such as a combination of properties like `blockchain` and `currency`.

#### 7. **Inconsistent Logic in Filter Function**
   **Problem:**  
   The filter function contains contradictory logic: it returns `true` when `balance.amount <= 0` and `priority > -99`, which seems incorrect.

   **Solution:**  
   Fix the logic to filter for balances with a positive amount and a priority greater than -99.

#### 8. **Use Type `any`**
   **Problem:**  
   The `blockchain` parameter in `getPriority` is typed as `any`, which defeats the purpose of using TypeScript.

   **Solution:**  
   Replace `any` with a more specific type, such as a union of the supported blockchain names (`'Osmosis' | 'Ethereum' | 'Arbitrum' | 'Zilliqa' | 'Neo'`).

#### 9. **Wrong Destructured Variable**
   **Problem:**  
   `children` is destructured from `props`, but it is never used.

   **Solution:**  
   Remove the destructured `children` if it is not required in the component.

#### 10. **Missing Return Type in Sort Comparator**
   **Problem:**  
   The sort comparator is missing a return value in the case where `leftPriority` and `rightPriority` are equal.

   **Solution:**  
   Add `return 0` for cases where the two items are equal.

### Refactored Version

```tsx
// Define proper types with all required properties
interface WalletBalance {
  currency: string;
  amount: number;
  blockchain: string;
}

interface FormattedWalletBalance extends WalletBalance {
  formatted: string;
  usdValue: number;
}

interface BoxProps {
  className?: string;
  // Add other BoxProps as needed
}

interface Props extends BoxProps {}

// Define blockchain as a union type for better type safety
type Blockchain = 'Osmosis' | 'Ethereum' | 'Arbitrum' | 'Zilliqa' | 'Neo' | string;

const WalletPage: React.FC<Props> = ({ ...rest }) => {
  const balances = useWalletBalances();
  const prices = usePrices();

  // Use a more specific type instead of any
  const getPriority = (blockchain: Blockchain): number => {
    switch (blockchain) {
      case 'Osmosis':
        return 100;
      case 'Ethereum':
        return 50;
      case 'Arbitrum':
        return 30;
      case 'Zilliqa':
      case 'Neo':
        return 20;
      default:
        return -99;
    }
  };

  // Combine filtering, sorting, and formatting in one memoized operation
  const formattedBalances = useMemo(() => {
    return balances
      .filter((balance: WalletBalance) => {
        // Fixed variable reference and logic
        const priority = getPriority(balance.blockchain);
        // Keep balances with priority > -99 and amount > 0
        return priority > -99 && balance.amount > 0;
      })
      .sort((lhs: WalletBalance, rhs: WalletBalance) => {
        const leftPriority = getPriority(lhs.blockchain);
        const rightPriority = getPriority(rhs.blockchain);
        // Proper sort comparator with all cases handled
        if (leftPriority > rightPriority) return -1;
        if (rightPriority > leftPriority) return 1;
        return 0; // Equal priorities
      })
      .map((balance: WalletBalance) => {
        // Create formatted balances with USD value
        const usdValue = prices[balance.currency] * balance.amount;
        return {
          ...balance,
          formatted: balance.amount.toFixed(2), // Added precision
          usdValue
        };
      });
  }, [balances, prices]); // Now prices is actually used in the calculation

  return (
    <div {...rest}>
      {formattedBalances.map((balance: FormattedWalletBalance) => (
        <WalletRow
          className={classes.row}
          key={`${balance.blockchain}-${balance.currency}`} // Better key
          amount={balance.amount}
          usdValue={balance.usdValue}
          formattedAmount={balance.formatted}
        />
      ))}
    </div>
  );
};
```

### Key Improvements:

1. **Fixed Type**:  
   Added the missing `blockchain` property in the interfaces and used a union type for the blockchain names.

2. **Improved Logic Flow**:  
   Combined filtering, sorting, and formatting into a single `useMemo` block.

3. **Fixed Logic Issues**:  
   Corrected the filter logic and variable references.

4. **Improve Type Safety**:  
   Used a more specific type for `blockchain` and avoided the use of `any`.

5. **Optimized Rendering**:  
   Used a unique key for list items (`blockchain` + `currency`) to improve React performance.

6. **Code Style**:  
   Cleaned up code structure and added proper type handling.

7. **Reduced Redundancy**:  
   Eliminated unnecessary `formattedBalances` array creation and simplified the flow.
